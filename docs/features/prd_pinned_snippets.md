  - *Measurement*: Track snippet usage frequency before/after implementation

- **Improve user retention**
  - *Target*: 15% reduction in 30-day churn
  - *Validation*: Analysis shows users with organized snippets have 3x retention
  - *Measurement*: Compare retention rates between users who pin vs. don't pin snippets

- **Foundation for organization**
  - *Target*: Enable future folder/tagging features
  - *Validation*: Technical spike confirms extensible data model

- [ ] Pinned snippets appear in a dedicated "Pinned" section at the top
- [ ] Pinned state persists across browser sessions and devices
- [ ] Visual indicators:
  - Filled star (â˜…) for pinned items
  - Subtle animation on state change
  - Tooltip shows "Pin/Unpin" on hover
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+P) for power users

**Validation criteria:**
- 90% success rate in usability testing for pinning flow
- <100ms response time for pin/unpin actions
- 100% consistency in pinned state after page refresh

#### US-002: Viewing pinned snippets

- [ ] Tab navigation to star icons
- [ ] Space/Enter to toggle pin state
- [ ] Screen reader announcements for state changes
- [ ] Keyboard shortcut documentation in help

#### US-006: Screen reader support
As a visually impaired user, I want to understand and control pinned snippets.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] ARIA labels for all interactive elements
- [ ] Status messages for state changes

- [ ] High contrast mode support

### 3.4 Performance requirements
- Initial load with pinned items: <200ms
- Pin/unpin action: <50ms
- Sync latency: <1s in normal conditions
- Memory usage: <5MB additional for pinned state
- Offline queue: Support 100+ queued operations

## 4. Technical specifications

### 4.1 Data model

#### Snippet schema update
```typescript
interface Snippet {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
  isPinned: boolean;  // New field
  pinnedAt?: Date;    // Timestamp of when pinned (for sorting)
  lastUsedAt?: Date; // For smart sorting
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
  syncStatus?: {
    isSyncing: boolean;
    lastSynced: Date;
    error?: string;
  };
  // ... other existing fields
}
```

### 4.2 API changes

#### Update snippet endpoint
```typescript
// Request
PATCH /api/snippets/:id
{
  "isPinned": boolean,
  "clientTimestamp": string // ISO 8601
}

// Response
{
  "success": boolean,
  "data": Snippet,
  "syncStatus": {
    "pendingChanges": number,
    "lastSync": string
  }
}
```

### 4.3 State management

#### Pin state machine
```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Unpinned
    Unpinned --> Pinning: Pin action
    Pinning --> Pinned: Success
    Pinning --> Error: Failure
    Pinned --> Unpinning: Unpin action
    Unpinning --> Unpinned: Success
    Unpinning --> Error: Failure
    Error --> Pinning: Retry
    Error --> Unpinned: Cancel
```

### 4.4 Performance considerations
- **IndexedDB**: Add index for `isPinned` and `pinnedAt`
- **Pagination**: Load pinned items first, then lazy-load others
- **Debouncing**: Batch rapid pin/unpin actions
- **Memory**: Virtualize long lists of snippets
- **Caching**: Cache pinned snippets in memory for quick access

### 4.5 Security considerations
- Validate snippet ownership before pin/unpin
- Rate limiting on pin operations
- Encrypt pinned state in transit and at rest
- Audit log for admin actions

## 8. Open questions & decisions

### 8.1 Key decisions
| Question | Decision | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Pinned in search? | Yes, with badge | Maintains context while keeping pinned items accessible |
| Keyboard shortcut? | Ctrl+Shift+P | Consistent with platform conventions |
| Sort order | PinnedAt (newest first) | Most recent pins likely most relevant |
| Limit per user | 10 (configurable) | Balances utility with performance |
| Offline support | Queue and retry | Ensures no data loss |

### 8.2 Remaining questions
1. Should we allow pinning from search results?
2. Do we need bulk pin/unpin actions?
3. Should pinned snippets be included in exports?
4. How to handle pinned items when snippet is deleted?
5. Should there be a "recently pinned" section?
