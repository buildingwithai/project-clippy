# Privacy Policy for Project Clippy

**Effective Date:** June 5, 2025

Thank you for using Project Clippy (the "Extension"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our Extension.

## 1. Information We Handle

Project Clippy is designed to help you save and reuse snippets of text ("Snippets"). The Extension handles the following types of information:

*   **User-Created Snippets:** Any text, code, or other content that you voluntarily save as a Snippet using the Extension.

## 2. Data Storage - Strictly Local

**All Snippets and associated data created and managed by Project Clippy are stored exclusively on your local device using the browser's `chrome.storage.local` API.**

*   **No External Transmission:** We do not collect, transmit, store, or have access to your Snippets on any external servers or third-party services. Your Snippets remain on your computer.
*   **Developer Access:** As developers of Project Clippy, we do not have access to the content of the Snippets you save.

## 3. Permissions Used

Project Clippy requests the following permissions in your browser, solely to enable its core functionality:

*   **`storage`:** Essential for locally storing your Snippets on your device.
*   **`contextMenus`:** To provide right-click options for saving selected text as a Snippet or inserting saved Snippets.
*   **`activeTab`:** To allow the Extension to interact with the currently active webpage (e.g., to retrieve selected text or insert Snippets) when you initiate an action via the context menu or the Extension's popup. This permission grants temporary access and does not allow us to track your browsing history.
*   **`scripting`:** Used to execute code on the active webpage when initiated by you (e.g., through a context menu click or popup interaction) to perform actions like getting selected text or inserting a Snippet into a text field.

## 4. User Responsibilities

You are solely responsible for the content of the Snippets you create and save using the Extension. Please be mindful of saving sensitive or personal information.

## 5. Data Security

The security of your locally stored Snippets depends on the security of your browser and your computer. We rely on the security mechanisms provided by your web browser to protect data stored via `chrome.storage.local`.

## 6. Children's Privacy

Project Clippy is not intended for use by children under the age of 13 (or the relevant age in your jurisdiction), and we do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the Extension's description on the Chrome Web Store or through other appropriate means. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
